## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  - Check Distribution of Physical Activity Levels
  - Breakdown by Key Demographics e.g., gender
  - Explore relationships with other variables
  
  
## Statistical Analysis
Since the response variable is categorical, we consider the following models:

1. Ordinal Logistic Regression (if responses have a natural order)
  - Simplify to a binary response initially
  
2. Mixed-Effects Model (to account for country-level differences)
  - Since data is grouped by country, a Multilevel Model can help
  
Interpret Coefficients:
  - Identify significant predictors
  - Estimate the likelihood of engaging in physical activity across different groups
